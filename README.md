# Distributed Log Monitoring

Keeping tabs on what’s happening across your systems in real time is more important than ever — whether you're chasing down bugs, keeping things secure, or just making sure everything's running smoothly. \*Enter\* this project.

## Build Steps

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```
Nice setup! Here's a **cool, dev-friendly README** you can drop into your GitHub repo to showcase your log analytics platform. It highlights the tech stack, explains how to get started, and shows off the key features in a clean, engaging way.
