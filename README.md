##  Features

- [x] Real-time log ingestion with Kafka
- [x] Easy log querying via Loki
- [x] Structured storage in PostgreSQL
- [x] Beautiful, pre-configured Grafana dashboards
- [x] Lightweight and **memory efficient**
- [x] Plug-and-play with Docker Compose

## Dev Notes

- Topics auto-created: `application_logs`, `application_errors`

##  Customization

Want to add your own microservice or log source? Just plug it into Kafka or Promtail and extend the dashboards in Grafana. It’s modular and easy to scale.
